# burger

*This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.*
*Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.*
*Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move[coming soon!] to the right side of the page.*
*Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.*
